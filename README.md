# Interactive Poetry Project

### [Interactive Poetry Project](https://interactive-poetry.johnnyhperkins.now.sh)

Interactive Poetry is an idea pioneered by Hala Alyan and first published in Thrush. This project uses React Hooks, GraphQL/Apollo, and Mongoose.

## Local set up

Run `yarn dev` in root to start the Apollo server and `yarn start` in the client directory to start react scripts. You'll also need to create a .env file in the root with the API keys (provided on request)
